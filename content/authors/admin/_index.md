my interest lies in the intersection of Statistical & Computational methods and Artificial Intelligence and their applications in Finance. More specifically, I am interested in leveraging state-of-the-art statistical methods and their application in Risk management and Portfolio optimization. Apart from that, I have also a keen interest in understanding International finance, Microfinance, Sustainable investing, and the economy of Banking, Money, and the financial market.{style="text-align: justify;"}
